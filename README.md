## About Me

I'm a senior undergraduate student at **Stony Brook University**, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My research interests are at the intersection of **AI for Science**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Generative Models**.

- **Research Focus:**  
  Leveraging LLMs for molecular optimization and drug editing—investigating how language-based models can understand and manipulate chemical structures using SMILES, SELFIES, and graph-based prompts. I am also interested in generative models that propose novel molecules with desirable properties under complex constraints.

- **Vision:**  
  I see LLMs and generative models as foundational tools for the future of scientific discovery. These models enable new ways to encode domain knowledge, reason over structured and symbolic data, and explore physical design spaces for chemical and material innovation.

- **Current Goal:**  
  Preparing to apply for **Ph.D. or M.S. programs for Fall 2026** to pursue research in machine learning with applications in molecular design, scientific discovery, and automated reasoning.

- **Advised by:**  
  [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/) at Stony Brook University
